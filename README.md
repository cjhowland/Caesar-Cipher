# Caesar-Cipher

This Python script uses the Caesar cipher encryption technique, in which each letter of plaintext message is shifted a fixed number of letters down the alphabet. The script uses multiple classes to encrypt and decrypt messages.

CaesarCipher.py: This main script contains all classes, functions, and testing necessary to encrypt and decrypt strings and text files. It prompts the user to encrypt or decrypt a piece of text or a file.

Words.txt: This text file contains 55902 valid words. The main script loads this file to test the number of valid words generated by each alphabet shift in the decryption process.

EncodedCoverLetter.txt: This text file contains an encoded message that can be decrypted using the main script.
